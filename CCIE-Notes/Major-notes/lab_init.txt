Since this is a Routing & Switching lab.  I went through all the routing
protocols, not just the command references but also how they work.  When I see
a question on the lab.  You would know the exact config you need to make it
work.

If you go through the above list, understand your routing protocols and knows
the exact config when you see the requirements.  I'm sure you will pass the
exam with ease.

Last but not least.  I want to thank Paul for hosting this group and I want to
thank all of the members in this group.  You guys helped me pass my lab.


Good Luck to all of you and let us know when you pass.
